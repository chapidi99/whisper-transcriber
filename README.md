Building a Multilingual Transcription App Using Whisper and Streamlit
ðŸš€ Why I Built ThisÂ App
In a recent research project, our team was tasked with transcribing hundreds of hours of interviews conducted in German and Turkish. However, due to policy constraints, we were required to use an officially approved toolâ€Š-â€ŠAmberscriptâ€Š-â€Šfor the final transcription. While Amberscript is a great tool, I realized there are moments in research and academic work where having an in-house, open-source transcription solution could provide:
âœ… Flexibility to handle different languages
âœ… Full control over data (especially for sensitive files)
âœ… Zero cost at scale
âœ… Customizability to add features like translation, summarization, etc.
That curiosity led me to build this lightweight yet powerful web-based transcription app using OpenAI's Whisper model and Streamlit.
